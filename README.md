## Overview
De-Trade: Powering the Future of Decentralized Trading
Decentralizing stock market trading eliminates intermediaries, reducing fees and settlement times
while enabling direct peer-to-peer transactions. It enhances transparency and security by leveraging
blockchain, preventing manipulation and fraud. Unlike traditional markets with fixed hours, a decentralized
platform allows 24/7 global trading with real-time settlements, reducing counterparty risks. It also increases 
accessibility by removing geographic and financial barriers, ensuring true ownership control and censorship
resistance. Additionally, smart contracts enable automated trading, fractional ownership, and innovative financial 
instruments, transforming the stock market into a more open, efficient, and inclusive ecosystem.
